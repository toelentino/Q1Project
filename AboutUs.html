        <h1>Welcome to Planetarium!</h1>
        <p>This is a website based on the movie La La Land's clothing and more.</p>
        <p>"Here's to the one's who dream."</p>

        <h2>Who are we, and why?</h2>
                    <p>As our generation today mostly listens to pop and rock, we would want to revive the jazz sensation. After watching La La Land, we realized that jazz does not only play a significant role in our minds, but also in our hearts. </p>

                    <p>We are a group of individuals who have a love for the movie La La Land, where we also derived our name, "Planetarium" (a song composed by Justin Hurwitz from the movie). If you don't know what the movie is about; Basically, it's just a story of a boy and a girl who has different pursuits in life. La La Land isn't just some kind of jazz and romance movie that people think it is, it's much more deeper than that. We, the Planetarium Team, admire La La Land's visuals and aesthetics. Thus, leading us to create this shop. We would want to showcase the different styles Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling wore, as their clothings bring us way back.</p>

                    <p>Our website is not just for our love for music, but it is also for our passion in regards to old-style clothing for dancing and day-to-day wearing. Not everyone gets to wear vintage clothes anymore, which is why we still need to acknowledge it. We have created different clothings with a twist of Gen-Z, of course. We also have a variety of clothing for kids, adults, and even seniors! We believe that everyone has the right to exprress themselves through their clothings and different styles when it comes to grooving, or just basically anything.</p>
